summary: |
  I've started my career as an IT consultant at Accenture, working for the Resources business (electricity, petrol). 
  I dedicated four years to helping companies with digital transformations and paperless workflows using Windows and ASP.NET software.

  After that I started as a backend developer at one of the biggest telcos in Portugal. There I helped implement scalable solutions 
  to support the TV multimedia business, including backends for user profiles, cloud-based PVR, and Auto Configuration Systems.

  When the need for moving to the cloud and DevOps transformation arose, I transitioned to DevOps Engineering. Now I lead a 
  Platforms Engineering team, creating self-service platforms for cloud native deployments with high automation, observability, and resilience.
