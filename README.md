# The great CV

This is my own CV, as a site. I choose it to be a website for the obvious reason that I am a web developer.

You can find the theme in [the toha github repo](https://github.com/hugo-themes/toha).

## Build

`cd` into the `src` folder and run `hugo -b "https://jtsoar.es" --gc --minify` or run it locally with `hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 --disableFastRender`.
